Verify pipeline interaction

Narrative:
In order to observe service state
As a test framework
I want to interact with the pipeline
					 
Scenario: capture pipeline to prove interaction  
#Given step represents a precondition to an event

Scenario: Then Verify pipeline contents  
#Given step represents a precondition to an event


#Scenario:  Another scenario exploring different combination of events
#Given a precondition  
#When a negative event occurs  
#Then a the outcome should be captured
